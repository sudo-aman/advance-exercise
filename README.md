# Modulo Three Finite State Machine (FSM)

This React component implements a finite state machine (FSM) to compute the modulo of a binary string by three.

## Usage

The `ModuloThreeFSM` component accepts a binary string as input and computes the remainder when the binary number represented by the string is divided by three.

To use this component:

1. Import the `ModuloThreeFSM` component into your React application.
2. Place the `ModuloThreeFSM` component within your application's component tree.
3. Input a binary string into the component.
4. Click the "Compute Remainder" button to compute the remainder.
5. The output will display the final state of the FSM, representing the remainder when divided by three.

## Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ModuloThreeFSM from "./components/ModuloThreeFSM";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ModuloThreeFSM />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
